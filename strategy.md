Position is EXTREMELY valuable.

Discard any trash or marginal cards in early positions.
I have to act first, and quite often will be putting money into pot.
And then met with aggression from later position would have to fold
my marginal\weak hand. 

In Dealer\LP, I can go with marginal hands, and still have a good chance
of taking the pot, even if my hand might not be the best.

Sometimes, I might meet strong aggression (re-raise). Do not assume that player
is bluffing. Usually it means they have a strong hand, and better to fold.
Unless of course I have an extremely strong hand with very high equity.
