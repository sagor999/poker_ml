going to start writing strategy down.

Tight Aggressive style. (maybe too tight though??)
should write some type of hand analyzer, that would show me how many hands I folded that I could have won (if they went into showdown).

Pre-flop:
Raise (3 BB):
  A\K\Q\J with up to T
  suitted connectors A\K\Q\J with 2-T for potential flash\straight
  any pair
Fold the rest.

Flop:




verify flush odds. I think it should be close to 25%?
which would mean calling with any suited hands is a good strategy:
5108 hands of flush. probability is 0.001

and then odds of a straight when holding connectors:
there are 10,200 straight hands. probability is 0.003

so it would seem like hoping for the flush might not be all that great of a strategy.
especially if playing with 72 or 48 etc type of hands, that have very little chance of
connecting in other ways.
