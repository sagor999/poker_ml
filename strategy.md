Position is EXTREMELY valuable.

Discard any trash or marginal cards in early positions.
I have to act first, and quite often will be putting money into pot.
And then met with aggression from later position would have to fold
my marginal\weak hand. 

In Dealer\LP, I can go with marginal hands, and still have a good chance
of taking the pot, even if my hand might not be the best.

Sometimes, I might meet strong aggression (re-raise). Do not assume that player
is bluffing. Usually it means they have a strong hand, and better to fold.
Unless of course I have an extremely strong hand with very high equity.


6 vs 9 table:
6 is much more active, and you get more action, due to more chances being at the button.
but also have to pay blinds more often.
9 is very slow sometimes. like mollases. gets boring.
probably stick to 6 for now?


Noticed that I am not playing good in the evening. When I am tired, I tend to gamble and
do stupid decisions.

Also I need to tighten my range just a tad I feel like, especially 30 min into the game.
I noticed I get bored and start playing weaker games, then catch a week pair and get way
too aggressive. 
I am too aggressive, and quite often put money into pot. 
Look at the hand, if it is nuts or near to it, then be aggressive, otherwise pair it down I think.

Also, do not think that other player is bluffing or semi bluffing. If someone posts 20+BB raise,
most probably they have nuts and best option is to fold.


From the book:
Optimal strategy is to always bet 41% of the pot. (?)

Preflop:
Always raise with any position that I intent to enter the pot (never call).
Raise double BB, or 3 BB when on the button.
Play very tight range under the gun.
And get looser as you get to the button. Be quite loose on the button. (need to define).

Need to write down full on strategy to follow.
Which cards I play on each position.

How I play cards on the flop. 
And how I bet on each street. 
To ensure that actions are uniform, and opponent cannot extract information.
How much to bet? It seems like range is between 1/2 to 3/4 of the pot.
On the river, it seems like good bet is 1/6 of the pot.

Need to categorize each action into:
check\fold
check\call
check\raise
call\fold to reraise
call\re-raise
