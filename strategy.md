Position is EXTREMELY valuable.

Discard any trash or marginal cards in early positions.
I have to act first, and quite often will be putting money into pot.
And then met with aggression from later position would have to fold
my marginal\weak hand. 

In Dealer\LP, I can go with marginal hands, and still have a good chance
of taking the pot, even if my hand might not be the best.

Sometimes, I might meet strong aggression (re-raise). Do not assume that player
is bluffing. Usually it means they have a strong hand, and better to fold.
Unless of course I have an extremely strong hand with very high equity.


6 vs 9 table:
6 is much more active, and you get more action, due to more chances being at the button.
but also have to pay blinds more often.
9 is very slow sometimes. like mollases. gets boring.
probably stick to 6 for now?


Noticed that I am not playing good in the evening. When I am tired, I tend to gamble and
do stupid decisions.
