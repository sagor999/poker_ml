going to start writing strategy down.

Tight Aggressive style. (maybe too tight though??)
should write some type of hand analyzer, that would show me how many hands I folded that I could have won (if they went into showdown).

Pre-flop:
Raise (3 BB):
  A\K\Q\J with up to T
  suitted connectors A\K\Q\J with 2-T for potential flash\straight
  any pair
Fold the rest.

Flop:
