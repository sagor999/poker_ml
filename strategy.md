Position is EXTREMELY valuable.

Discard any trash or marginal cards in early positions.
I have to act first, and quite often will be putting money into pot.
And then met with aggression from later position would have to fold
my marginal\weak hand. 

In Dealer\LP, I can go with marginal hands, and still have a good chance
of taking the pot, even if my hand might not be the best.

Sometimes, I might meet strong aggression (re-raise). Do not assume that player
is bluffing. Usually it means they have a strong hand, and better to fold.
Unless of course I have an extremely strong hand with very high equity.


6 vs 9 table:
6 is much more active, and you get more action, due to more chances being at the button.
but also have to pay blinds more often.
9 is very slow sometimes. like mollases. gets boring.
probably stick to 6 for now?


Noticed that I am not playing good in the evening. When I am tired, I tend to gamble and
do stupid decisions.

Also I need to tighten my range just a tad I feel like, especially 30 min into the game.
I noticed I get bored and start playing weaker games, then catch a week pair and get way
too aggressive. 
I am too aggressive, and quite often put money into pot. 
Look at the hand, if it is nuts or near to it, then be aggressive, otherwise pair it down I think.

Also, do not think that other player is bluffing or semi bluffing. If someone posts 20+BB raise,
most probably they have nuts and best option is to fold.
