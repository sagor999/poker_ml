need to add another ML that would read whole table.
will output where all card locations are.
what state the game is in (none, preflop, etc)
what position I am in (where is the dealer button)



for equity calculation.
need to add how my hand compares to a range of hands that opponent might be playing.
can do static range?? have precomputed range for each position?
but how useful that is in small stakes table? where someone can play pretty much anything in
under the gun position?
